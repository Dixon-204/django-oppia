OppiaMobile App Permissions
===========================


In the OppiaMobile client (phone) app generally all users have the same functionality and permissions. The only 
difference is those users who are teachers who can the monitoring pages directly within the app. For admin and staff 
users to see these monitoring pages, they need to be explicitly assigned the teacher role in the appropriate cohorts and 
courses.

Restricting app permissions
----------------------------

There may be some cases (for example when using shared devices), where you may want to prevent app users from installing 
or removing courses, or change the particular app settings. The app has the option to set an admin password, which will 
then restrict access to options such as installing/removing courses. To enable this, go to the settings in the app, 
check the box to "protect admin actions with password" and enter an admin password.
